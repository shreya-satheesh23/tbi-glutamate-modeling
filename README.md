# TBI Glutamate Modeling

This repository contains a simulation-based exploration of glutamate dynamics in the somatosensory cortex following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Built from a computational neuroscience research project conducted at Boston University RISE, this project explores how perturbations to AMPAR function and astrocytic uptake affect EPSP and synaptic recovery.

This project uses Python simulations to model the effects of traumatic brain injury on glutamate dynamics in the somatosensory cortex, with a focus on synaptic depression, AMPAR kinetics, and astrocytic uptake. Built as part of a computational neuroscience research internship at Boston University, it reflects cross-disciplinary skills in data modeling, biological systems analysis, and scientific reasoning.
