# TBI Glutamate Modeling

This repository contains a simulation-based exploration of glutamate dynamics in the somatosensory cortex following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Built from a computational neuroscience research project conducted at Boston University RISE, this project explores how perturbations to AMPAR function and astrocytic uptake affect EPSP and synaptic recovery.

Project from 2023
